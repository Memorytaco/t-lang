# Syntax sugar in a compiler

A syntax sugar is usually designed to please user and provide convience.

This compiler provides two types of sugar for user.

1. term sugar: There is no concrete term sugar for user but a collection
   of rules for helping user defining their own rules, except difference
   between surface language and core language.
2. type sugar: Type sugar is mostly fixed and forbiding customization,
   but some professions may want to customise this so they can researcn
   and expand the type system.
